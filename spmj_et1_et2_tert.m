function [et1, et2, tert] = spmj_et1_et2_tert(fmapDir, funcDir, subj_name)
% spmj_et1_et2_tert calculates MRI timing parameters for field map correction.
%
% This function reads the necessary MRI acquisition parameters from the
% JSON metadata associated with the subject's field map and first functional
% MRI run. It then computes and returns the first and second echo times
% (et1 and et2) in milliseconds, as well as the total effective EPI readout
% time (tert) considering GRAPPA acceleration.
% 
% You can verify these parameters in the scan protocol 
% et1 = First echotime in ms of the field map (listed in contrast-common) 
% et2 = Second echotime in ms of the field map (listed in contrast-common) 
% total EPI readout time = = base resolution * echo spacing (in ms) / Accel. factor PE
% Baseresolution: number of lines in k-space without undersampling 
% echo spacing: time bewteen subsequent echos is ms: In Sequence - part 1
% Accel Factor PE:  Resolution iPat 
% 
% Inputs:
%   fmapDir: path to fmap in BIDS direcotry.
%   funcDir: path to func in BIDS direcotry.
%   subj_name: The subject's name as it appears in the DICOM server.
%
% Outputs:
%   et1: The first echo time in milliseconds.
%   et2: The second echo time in milliseconds.
%   tert: The total effective EPI readout time in milliseconds.

% total EPI readout time = = echo spacing (in ms) * base resolution

% you need to divide the total number of echos by two:

echo_spacing = func1st.EffectiveEchoSpacing * 1000;                        % compute echo spacing in milliseconds
tert = echo_spacing * num_of_echoes;                                 % for GRAPPA sequence, EffectiveEchoSpacing is the echospacing divided by the acceleration factor

%% retrieve et1 et2 (in milliseconds)
